# Day and Night

Day and Night are twin Dobson Newtonian reflector telescopes with a primary parabolic mirror of 8" (203mm) and a focal length of 800mm. Powered by a raspberry pi running Linux, they are fully automated, including star tracking and picture stacking. They are identical, except for that one is white and the other black. Light and darkness, day and night.
